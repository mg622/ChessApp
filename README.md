# ChessApp
 <br/>I made modifications to the repo below.<br/>
 <br/>I implemented a voice to text function, where the texts gets printed on the screen<br/>
 <br/>I did not implement it so the voice command moves any pieces because we decided not to use the app<br/>
 <br/>Made changes to the UI<br/>
